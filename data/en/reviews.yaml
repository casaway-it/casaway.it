          Very nice and loving hosts! The very clean and really nicely
          equipped apartment is in the center. So you are quickly in the
          center of the town in the evening and find connection to small bars
          or restaurants. You can also get insider tips from the hosts, where
          you can find the best pizza, etc. A highly recommended place to
          stay.

          We had a very pleasant stay. The house is spacious and tidy and the
          outside space is very nice. The house is in a nice and quiet area.

          Very cosy and lovely house on a nice hill spot. The views from the
          windows and garden are very nice. The house itself is pleasant with
          a nice, surrounding garden. The hot tub is a nice bonus. Federico is
          a very nice host and always super quick to respond for help and
          answering questions. We had a great stay with our family of 5
          (children of ages 1, 10, and 12). Thanks Federico!

          Loved the outside garden with a wonderful view, loved the silence
          and the surrounding nature. The house is very beautiful with
          everything you need and is spacious.  Impeccable cleanliness. Fast
          wi-fi connection. Excellent location for visiting the Langhe.
          Federico was super kind and welcoming, he accompanied us during our
          stay and respected our every request.

          Like in the pictures, the flat is well located and easy to find.
          Federico is a great host, very responsive, helpful, available, and
          of great advices! We stayed there for the F1 Grand Prix and we were
          very happy with everything. Thank you again Federico, if we come
          back in Italy we'll see you again!

          Cute studio, small but very well furnished. Convenient as it is
          located in the heart of Vimercate, it has all the necessary comforts
          for a comfortable stay. Quiet, quiet, very friendly and helpful
          owner.

          The apartment is beautiful and very clean with everything you need
          arranged smartly in a small space. I spent two months in this
          apartment and Federico was always very helpful and attentive without
          being intrusive. The apartment is very central in a stately building
          and conveniently close to the highway.
